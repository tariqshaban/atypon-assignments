Assignment Grading System
==============================

A simple console application to implement basic CRUD operations on a grading system.

Assignment Requirements
------------

Build a grading system for assignments using Java with OO design. The system has a simple menu to enter commands and
data and show the results. The System can start with a static list of students (student name, id) and a static list of
assignments( Assignment number, Assignment name, weight), then you can enter the grades from each assignment for each
student from the console. After that, you can ask the system to show the results as explained in point 3.

1. Draw UML Class diagram for your classes
2. Implement your classes according to OOP and code reusability principles
3. Build a CLI menu from which you can send commands to your grading system. From the menu you can choose entering
   grades for a certain assignment, print average grade per assignment, print average grade per student, print students
   names and grades in a descending order based on the studentâ€™s average grade in all assignments.
